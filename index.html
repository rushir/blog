      The city life. Fast paced, movement, momentum. These things all encourage people to work hard, get things done. When I visited San Francisco I had a life changing moment. Three years ago I emailed Aza Raskin, wanting to talk to him about his life at Mozilla and the kinds of projects he was working on. Turned out that he was starting his own company, Massive Health. I, of course, asked him if I could show him some of the desktop screenshots I had made. His reply will forever remain in the "Favorites" of my email: "Would love to see your take on a Massive Health wallpaper. Your work is beautiful!" And so for the next few weeks I spent my time learning as much about Photoshop/Illustrator as I could, and made a wallpaper for Massive Health, the result, [http://www.flickr.com/photos/azaraskin/6299535327/]. Needless to say, I was ecstatic. I spent the next two years with Aza being my mentor. I would stay up until 2 AM on school nights to just talk to him and share my ideas. Through Aza I heard of Tristan Harris, a PM at Google, and Pascal Finette, a former colleague at Mozilla. I began talking to them both, about what I do and where I want to be. This past summer I had the opportunity to visit the Silicon Valley, I met Aza for the first time in person and had coffee with him at Sightglass, ate lunch/toured the Googleplex, visited Mozilla/Pascal, and then rode in a Model S back to the hotel. I fell in love with the environment around me, how happy the people were, active, I realized that it was my home, that somehow, someday, I needed to walk through the door of.
